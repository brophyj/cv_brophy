&lt;p&gt;The majority of Covid-19 cases in Quebec are on the island of Montreal. Using daily reports from Quebec public health, I have made a few graphs that explore the rate of infections during the month of April for the different Montreal neighbourhoods.&lt;br /&gt;
Data visualizations help to appreciate the time and geographic variations of Covid-19 infections. Infections started in central higher SES areas (? areas with more spring break travel) before spreading to predominately lower SES areas
&lt;a href=&#34;/post/Combined_map.html&#34;&gt;click here for interactive Montreal maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/covid_area.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously inferences of Montreal cases are limited by the uncertain quality of the data. With this caveat, here are some personal observations&lt;br /&gt;
* Early in the month, cases were highest in higher SES areas, likely highlighting ^ travel exposure in these areas&lt;br /&gt;
* As month progressed, saw the usual gradient of more cases in areas with lower SES and higher population densities&lt;br /&gt;
* No region has definitively ‚Äúturned the corner‚Äù, but the majority of areas seems to be leveling off, giving some hope that the announced progressive easing of current restrictions will not lead to a complete disaster&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Virtual Learning &amp; Corporate Sponsorship</title>

&lt;p&gt;One positive from the &lt;strong&gt;Covid-19&lt;/strong&gt; pandemic, is we have had to learn more techniques about online or virtual learning. The proliferation of these tools, such as Zoom, and our increased familiarity with their use will perhaps have a lasting impact on our learning processes. For example, with increased ease of online learning, perhaps we will reduce our carbon footprint for small, medium and even large medical conferences as we reduce our traveling and need for physical presence at these venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly in the academic world, we had to rapidly adapt (within a 2 week period) from giving standard onsite lectures to the virtual teaching world. Surprisingly, the transition was relatively painless. For example, I gave the last 12 hours of the winter semester of my intermediate epidemiology course to 71 MSc students via Zoom. The cost of this is farily trivial. I believe the price of a premium Zoom subscription is about $20 / month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these facts I was not surprised to receive a recent email about an upcoming virtual course on heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/ScreenShot_1.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what did surprise me was seeing that this symposium had &lt;strong&gt;12 corporate sponsors&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/ScreenShot_2.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises several questions:&lt;br /&gt;
- Why are academics so tied in with coroporate interests?&lt;br /&gt;
- Are academics only willing to participate if personal financial rewards are present?&lt;br /&gt;
- Coroporations are not philatrophic organizations, so what is the payoff for them?&lt;br /&gt;
- Is it a quasi guarantee that their products will be highlighted in a positive manner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is from a tweetorial looking at the safety and efficacy of digitalis in heart failure.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>CABG vs. PCI in LM</title>

&lt;p&gt;This is a blog post about a recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1909406&#34;&gt;NEJM article&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/PCI_CABG.jpg&#34; id=&#34;id&#34; class=&#34;class&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; style=&#34;width:75.0%;height:75.0%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the primary outcome result (difference, 2.8 percentage
points; 95% confidence interval [CI], ‚àí0.9 to 6.5; P = 0.13), the EXCEL authors conclude ‚ÄúIn patients with left main coronary artery disease of low or intermediate anatomical complexity, there was no significant difference between PCI and CABG‚Äù. Leaving aside that CABG was statistically superior in terms of total mortality, ischemia driven revascularization, and non-procedural myocardial infarction, it is questionable that the primary outcome data actually support their conclusion. EXCEL was originally designed as a non-inferiority (NI) study with a margin of 4.2%, which en passant many would consider too liberal. Even accepting that margin, how can a primary outcome with a 95% upper CI of 6.5%, exceeding the original NI margin be used to support their conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;
