Using daily reports from Quebec public health, I have made a few graphs that explore the rate of infections during the month of April for the different Montreal neighbourhoods.\nData visualizations help to appreciate the time and geographic variations of Covid-19 infections. Infections started in central higher SES areas (? areas with more spring break travel) before spreading to predominately lower SES areas click here for interactive Montreal maps\nObviously inferences of Montreal cases are limited by the uncertain quality of the data. With this caveat, here are some personal observations\n* Early in the month, cases were highest in higher SES areas, likely highlighting ^ travel exposure in these areas\n* As month progressed, saw the usual gradient of more cases in areas with lower SES and higher population densities\n* No region has definitively ‚Äúturned the corner‚Äù, but the majority of areas seems to be leveling off, giving some hope that the announced progressive easing of current restrictions will not lead to a complete disaster\n","date":1588636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588726174,"objectID":"2af82c5418eb73c61ac00b95f43a74b6","permalink":"/post/covid-visualizations/","publishdate":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/covid-visualizations/","section":"post","summary":"The majority of Covid-19 cases in Quebec are on the island of Montreal.

The proliferation of these tools, such as Zoom, and our increased familiarity with their use will perhaps have a lasting impact on our learning processes. For example, with increased ease of online learning, perhaps we will reduce our carbon footprint for small, medium and even large medical conferences as we reduce our traveling and need for physical presence at these venues.\nCertainly in the academic world, we had to rapidly adapt (within a 2 week period) from giving standard onsite lectures to the virtual teaching world. Surprisingly, the transition was relatively painless. For example, I gave the last 12 hours of the winter semester of my intermediate epidemiology course to 71 MSc students via Zoom. The cost of this is farily trivial. I believe the price of a premium Zoom subscription is about $20 / month.\nGiven these facts I was not surprised to receive a recent email about an upcoming virtual course on heart failure.\nHowever, what did surprise me was seeing that this symposium had 12 corporate sponsors!\nThis raises several questions:\n- Why are academics so tied in with coroporate interests?\n- Are academics only willing to participate if personal financial rewards are present?\n- Coroporations are not philatrophic organizations, so what is the payoff for them?\n- Is it a quasi guarantee that their products will be highlighted in a positive manner?\n","date":1586908800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586997811,"objectID":"0b2b06ebcf56d1f98a3058496be8869d","permalink":"/post/virtual-learning-corporate-sponsorship/","publishdate":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/virtual-learning-corporate-sponsorship/","section":"post","summary":"One positive from the Covid-19 pandemic, is we have had to learn more techniques about online or virtual learning.
